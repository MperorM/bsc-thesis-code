The code used to produce the results described in the paper

To reproduce results of the paper run notebooks in the following order:

1. Prepare_dataset.ipynb
2. train_random_forest.ipynb
3. LSTM.ipynb [optional]
4. benchmark_models.ipynb
5. plots.ipynb

The trained LSTM models are included in the repository.
To reproduce the LSTM model run LSTM.ipynb
Replace the models located in ./models/lstm_models/ with your newly trained models
